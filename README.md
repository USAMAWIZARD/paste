# paste and get data anywhere
**You can paste your data such as text,links,images and files and get it where ever you want.**


## Motivation
** many a times you have to share data, such as small text links images files between diffrent devices, or you want to store it so that you can get it any where you want. **<br>
So in such situations what wolud you do, may be you will email it to your self, or store it on drive (cloud).<br>
But it will be difficult for you to login to your email whenever you want your data back.<br>
and mailing it will require a lot of time.<br>
So I thougt why not make this as simple as possible.<br>
